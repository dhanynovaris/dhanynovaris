	  Rubick, the Grand Magus, is a ranged intelligence hero best known for his ability to copy the spells of his enemies and use them as his own.<br>
	  Although he is mostly played as a support and is extremely fragile the entire length of the game,<br>
	  he can still prove to be one of the most influential heroes if he utilizes good positioning and well-timed usage of his ultimate,Spell Steal.<br>
	  Spell Steal allows Rubick to cast an enemy hero's most recently used spell, giving him supreme versatility throughout the game. By stealing the right abilities,<br>
	  the Grand Magus can aid himself and allies by casting crippling disables, applying curses, unleashing powerful nukes, disorienting the enemy team, supporting his allies with buffs,<br>
	  escaping from rough situations, or even enhancing his own physical attacks.<br>
	  His other abilities are just as worthy of a Magus: Telekinesis lets Rubick magically lift an enemy into the air, rendering the target helpless and vulnerable,<br>
	  before hurling the lifted enemy to the ground up to a short distance away and stunning nearby foes on impact. Fade Bolt blasts enemies with a stream of arcane energy which bounces to all enemies nearby,<br>
	  dealing damage and reducing their attack damage. Arcane Supremacy is a passive ability, which increases cast range and amplifies the spell damage of Rubick's stolen spells.<br>
	  Rubick's versatile ability-set and his infamous Spell Steal make him a flexible and powerful hero that can work in any lineup although he does suffer from long cooldowns and the surfacing predictability of his ultimate
